Paperclip FFMPEG
================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/owahab/paperclip-ffmpeg.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/owahab/paperclip-ffmpeg)

Adding video handling to Paperclip via ffmpeg.
This gem has been tested under Linux and Mac OS X, YMMV under Windows.

Requirements
------------

FFMPEG must be installed and Paperclip must have access to it. To ensure
that it does, on your command line, run `which ffmpeg`.
This will give you the path where ffmpeg is installed. For
example, it might return `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`.

Then, in your environment config file, let Paperclip know to look there by adding that
directory to its path.

In development mode, you might add this line to `config/environments/development.rb)`:

```ruby
Paperclip.options[:command_path] = "/usr/local/bin/"
```

Installation
------------

Include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "paperclip-ffmpeg"
```

Quick Start
-----------

In your model:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => {
    :medium => { :geometry => "640x480", :format => 'flv' },
    :thumb => { :geometry => "100x100#", :format => 'jpg', :time => 10 }
  }, :processors => [:ffmpeg]
end
```

This will produce:

1. A transcoded `:medium` FLV file with the requested dimensions if they will match the aspect ratio of the original file, otherwise, width will be maintained and height will be recalculated to keep the original aspect ration.
2. A screenshot `:thumb` with the requested dimensions regardless of the aspect ratio.

You may optionally add `<attachment>_meta` to your model and paperclip-ffmpeg will add information about the processed video.

Streaming Video
-------------------

When ffmpeg produces mp4 files, it places the moov atom at the end which makes it unstreamable. To handle this, paperclip-ffmpeg includes a processor to run qtfaststart after producing the video file.

In your model:

```ruby
class Lesson < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :video, :styles => {
    :mobile => {:geometry => "400x300", :format => 'mp4', :streaming => true}
  }, :processors => [:ffmpeg, :qtfaststart]
end
```
